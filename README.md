# Genome assembly and gene expression analysis of *Niphotrichum japonicum* under heat stress

*Niphotrichum japonicum* is a moss species known for its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures, drought, nutrient limitation, and intense light exposure (Zhou et al., 2023). To better understand the genetic mechanisms behind this stress tolerance, this project will assemble and annotate its genome, focusing on a single chromosome, to identify differentially expressed genes under heat stress.


> [!NOTE]
> The project uses data derived from Zhou et al. (2023), “Chromosome-level genome assembly of *Niphotrichum japonicum* provides new insights into heat stress responses in mosses.”

## Goals

- Assemble one chromosome of the *Niphotrichum japonicum* genome using Nanopore long reads and Illumina short reads.  
- Functionally annotate the assembled chromosome.  
- Identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) under heat stress.  
- *(Extra)* Incorporate Hi-C data to improve assembly scaffolding.  
- *(Extra)* Perform gene enrichment analysis for unique and/or differentially expressed genes.
